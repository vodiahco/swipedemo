SwipeListView illustration pack

I created this SwipeListView demo because I have seen so many posts on the internet about people struggling to get started with SwipeListView.
SwipeListView is a great library but unfortunately not very many documentation.
This post is meant to illustrate starting up with SwipleListView on the android studio (version 0.2.8).
I assume you are already familiar with android and android studio. You can read up the tutorial at:  http://modewagon.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/getting-started-with-swipelistview/
